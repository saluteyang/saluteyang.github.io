  My name is David Yang. I would like you to think that in my spare time, I like to do data science projects that give me personal enrichment and meaning. But honestly, data can be fun and tell an untold story. My archival impulse is compelling me to write down some of my past data related journeys. Enjoy and thanks for visiting!
